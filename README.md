## Welcome to my new dbt project!

This project is part of the Stack Academy Zero Data Engineering course. Our goal is to create a simple process of transforming and ingesting data using the DBT framework. We will perform some testing and load execution for the Amazon Redshift cluster. We will use a Docker image with the necessary infrastructure and Visual Studio Code to upload the code to the Git Hub repository.

### Undustending the project

We initially created the Dockfile file to obtain a Docker image with Ubuntu 20.04, Amazon Redshift, Python 3.8, Git and DBT. We use VS Code to deply and install programs, update and test their functionality. We created the Data Warehouse on the AWS cloud and accessed the data through DBeaver. We created the operator on Github to check the code locally and cloned the files.
